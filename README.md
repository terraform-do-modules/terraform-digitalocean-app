We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [_fifty plus terraform modules_][terraform_modules]. A few of them are completed and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.

## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 1.5.4](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)

## Examples

**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/terraform-do-modules/terraform-digitalocean-app/releases).

Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:

## basic example

```hcl
module "app" {
  source          = "terraform-do-modules/app/digitalocean"
  version         = "1.0.2"
  spec = [{
    name   = "test"
    region = "nyc"

    domain = {
      name = "test.do.clouddrove.ca"
      type = "PRIMARY"
      zone = "do.clouddrove.ca"
    }

    service = {
      name = "librqary-nginx"
      image = {
        registry_type  = "DOCKER_HUB"
        registry       = "library"
        repository     = "nginx"
        tag            = "latest"
        internal_ports = "80"
        deploy_on_push = {
          enabled = true
        }
      }
      alert = {
        rule     = "CPU_UTILIZATION"
        value    = 50
        operator = "GREATER_THAN"
        window   = "FIVE_MINUTES"
        disabled = false
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## complete example

```hcl
module "app" {
  source          = "terraform-do-modules/app/digitalocean"
  version         = "1.0.2"
  spec = [{
    name   = "test"
    region = "nyc"
    domain = {
      name = "test.do.clouddrove.ca"
      type = "PRIMARY"
      zone = "do.clouddrove.ca"
    }

    static_site = {
      name             = "blog"
      build_command    = "bundle exec jekyll build -d ./public"
      environment_slug = "hugo"
      output_dir       = "/public"

      git = {
        repo_clone_url = "https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-jekyll.git"
        branch         = "main"
      }

      routes = {
        path = "/"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```

## advanced example

```hcl
module "app" {
  source  = "terraform-do-modules/app/digitalocean"
  version = "1.0.2"
  spec = [{
    name   = "app-name"
    region = "nyc"

    database = {
      name         = "org-name-dev-mysql"
      engine       = "MYSQL"
      version      = "8"
      production   = true
      cluster_name = "org-name-dev-mysql"
      db_name      = "dev"
      db_user      = "app-name"
    }

    service = {
      name = "app-name"
      image = {
        registry_type  = "DOCKER_HUB"
        registry       = "songhanpoo"
        repository     = "wordpress-ols"
        tag            = "0.1.2"
        internal_ports = "80"
        deploy_on_push = {
          enabled = true
        }
      }

      alert = {
        rule     = "CPU_UTILIZATION"
        value    = 50
        operator = "GREATER_THAN"
        window   = "FIVE_MINUTES"
        disabled = false
      }

      env = [
        {
          key   = "DATABASE_HOST",
          type  = "GENERAL",
          value = module.mysql.database_cluster_private_host,
        },
        {
          key   = "DATABASE_PORT_NUMBER",
          type  = "GENERAL"
          value = module.mysql.database_cluster_port,
        },
        {
          key   = "DATABASE_NAME",
          type  = "GENERAL",
          value = "dev",

        {
          key   = "DATABASE_USER",
          type  = "SECRET",
          value = "app-name",
        },
        {
          key   = "DATABASE_PASSWORD",
          type  = "SECRET",
          value = module.mysql.database_cluster_password,
        },
      ]
    }
  }]

## Testing

In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest), and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:

```shell
  go test -run Test
```
