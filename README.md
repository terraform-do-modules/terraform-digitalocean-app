We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are completed and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 
- [Terraform 1.5.4](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/terraform-do-modules/terraform-digitalocean-app/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
## basic example
```hcl
module "app" {
  source          = "terraform-do-modules/app/digitalocean"
  version         = "1.0.2"
  spec = [{
    name   = "test"
    region = "nyc"

    domain = {
      name = "test.do.clouddrove.ca"
      type = "PRIMARY"
      zone = "do.clouddrove.ca"
    }

    service = {
      name = "librqary-nginx"
      image = {
        registry_type  = "DOCKER_HUB"
        registry       = "library"
        repository     = "nginx"
        tag            = "latest"
        internal_ports = "80"
        deploy_on_push = {
          enabled = true
        }
      }
      alert = {
        rule     = "CPU_UTILIZATION"
        value    = 50
        operator = "GREATER_THAN"
        window   = "FIVE_MINUTES"
        disabled = false
      }
    }
  }]
}
```
## complete example
```hcl
module "app" {
  source          = "terraform-do-modules/app/digitalocean"
  version         = "1.0.2"
  spec = [{
    name   = "test"
    region = "nyc"
    domain = {
      name = "test.do.clouddrove.ca"
      type = "PRIMARY"
      zone = "do.clouddrove.ca"
    }

    static_site = {
      name             = "blog"
      build_command    = "bundle exec jekyll build -d ./public"
      environment_slug = "hugo"
      output_dir       = "/public"

      git = {
        repo_clone_url = "https://github.com/digitalocean/sample-jekyll.git"
        branch         = "main"
      }

      routes = {
        path = "/"
      }
    }
  }]
}
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| enabled | Flag to control the resources creation. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| spec | (Required) A DigitalOcean App spec describing the app. | `any` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| active\_deployment\_id | The ID the app's currently active deployment. |
| created\_at | The date and time of when the app was created. |
| default\_ingress | The default URL to access the app. |
| id | ID of the app. |
| live\_url | The live URL of the app. |
| updated\_at | The date and time of when the app was last updated. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest), and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```shell
  go test -run Test
```
